# Zork AI Player

An AI-powered player for the classic text adventure game Zork using Claude.

## Overview

This application interfaces with Zork I (a classic text adventure game) and uses Claude AI to read game descriptions, make decisions, and enter commands to progress through the game.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Frotz** (Z-machine interpreter)
- **AI Provider** (choose one):
  - **Anthropic API Key** (for Claude)
  - **Ollama** (for local models)
- **Zork I game file** (.z5 format)

## Installation

### 1. Install Frotz

On macOS:
```bash
brew install frotz
```

On Linux:
```bash
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install frotz

# Fedora
sudo dnf install frotz

# Arch
sudo pacman -S frotz
```

### 2. Clone or Create Project Directory

```bash
mkdir -p ~/gudlyf/src/zork_ai
cd ~/gudlyf/src/zork_ai
```

### 3. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- `anthropic` - Claude API client
- `pexpect` - For reliable interaction with Frotz

### 4. Set Up AI Provider

**Option A: Anthropic API (Claude)**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

Or add it to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`:
```bash
echo 'export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Option B: Ollama (Local Models)**
```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Pull a model (e.g., Llama 3.2)
ollama pull llama3.2

# Start Ollama server
ollama serve
```

### 5. Download Zork I

Zork I, II, and III are freely distributed by Activision. You can download them from several sources:

**Option 1: IFDB (Interactive Fiction Database)**
- Visit: https://ifdb.org/viewgame?id=4gxk83ja4twckm6j
- Click "Play Online" or download the `.z5` file

**Option 2: IF Archive**
- Visit: http://www.ifarchive.org/indexes/if-archiveXgamesXzcode.html
- Look for Zork game files

**Option 3: Direct Download**
Several sites host the legal, free versions:
- The file is typically named `ZORK1.DAT` or `zork1.z5`
- You may need to extract it from a `.zip` file
- If the file has a `.DAT` extension, rename it to `.z5`

Save the file to your project:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/gudlyf/src/zork_ai/games
# Move your downloaded file
mv ~/Downloads/zork1.z5 ~/gudlyf/src/zork_ai/games/
```

## Usage

Run the AI player:

```bash
cd ~/gudlyf/src/zork_ai
python zork_ai_player.py games/zork1.z5
```

With custom number of turns:
```bash
python zork_ai_player.py games/zork1.z5 30
```

With verbose debug output:
```bash
python zork_ai_player.py games/zork1.z5 50 --verbose
# or
python zork_ai_player.py games/zork1.z5 50 -v
```

Disable auto-save:
```bash
python zork_ai_player.py games/zork1.z5 50 --no-autosave
```

Use custom save file:
```bash
python zork_ai_player.py games/zork1.z5 --save-file my_custom_save.sav
```

Use Ollama instead of Anthropic:
```bash
python zork_ai_player.py games/zork1.z5 --ollama
```

Use specific Ollama model:
```bash
python zork_ai_player.py games/zork1.z5 --ollama --ollama-model gpt-oss:20b
```

**Options:**
- First argument: Path to game file (required)
- Second argument: Number of turns (default: 50)
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Show debug messages in grey (optional)
- `--no-autosave`: Disable automatic saving (optional)
- `--save-file <path>`: Specify custom save file location (optional)
- `--ollama`: Use Ollama instead of Anthropic API (optional)
- `--ollama-model <name>`: Ollama model to use (default: llama3.2) (optional)
- `--ollama-url <url>`: Ollama server URL (default: http://localhost:11434) (optional)

## Debugging

Use the `--verbose` flag to see detailed debug information about the learning system:

```bash
python zork_ai_player.py games/zork1.z5 --verbose
```

**Debug Output Includes:**
- **Location Detection**: Shows when locations are found and extracted
- **Map Updates**: Shows when the mental map is updated with new locations
- **Learning Process**: Shows what data is being saved to the learning file
- **AI Context**: Shows what knowledge is being provided to the AI

**Example Debug Output:**
```
üîç Extracting location from 5 lines
üîç Line 0: 'EXAMINE WINDOW'
üîç Found command: 'EXAMINE WINDOW'
üîç Next line: 'Behind House                                        Score: 0     Moves: 16'
üîç Extracted location: 'Behind House'
üìç Location detected: 'Behind House'
üó∫Ô∏è  Map updated. Total locations: 2
üíæ Saving learning: 3 facts, 2 locations
üíæ Current location: Behind House
üíæ Visited locations: ['Kitchen', 'Behind House']
```

The AI will:
1. Read the game's text output
2. Analyze the situation using previous knowledge
3. Decide on the best command
4. Execute the command
5. Learn from the interaction
6. Repeat until the game ends or max turns reached

**Learning System in Action:**
```
üìö Loaded previous learning: 15 facts, 8 locations, 12 items
‚ñ∂ TURN 1
ü§ñ AI Command: EXAMINE LAMP
üìú Game Response: The lamp is on and provides light...
```

The AI remembers what it learned in previous sessions and uses this knowledge to make better decisions.

## How It Works

1. **Frotz Interface**: Uses `dfrotz` (dumb frotz) to run the Z-machine game file via subprocess
2. **AI Integration**: Sends game text to AI (Claude or Ollama) along with instructions about Zork
3. **Command Loop**: AI generates commands, sends them to Frotz, and reads responses
4. **Learning System**: AI learns from its experiences and builds knowledge across sessions
5. **System Prompt**: Includes detailed instructions about:
   - How Zork works
   - Valid command syntax
   - Game objectives
   - Strategy tips
   - Special game mechanics (like "passes through" objects)

## AI Provider Options

### **Anthropic API (Claude)**
- **Pros**: High-quality responses, reliable, cloud-based
- **Cons**: Requires API key, costs money, internet required
- **Best for**: Production use, high-quality gameplay

### **Ollama (Local Models)**
- **Pros**: Free, private, no internet required, customizable
- **Cons**: Requires local hardware, setup complexity
- **Best for**: Privacy, cost savings, experimentation

**Recommended Ollama Models:**
- `llama3.2` - Good balance of speed and quality
- `llama3.1` - Higher quality, slower
- `mistral` - Fast and efficient
- `codellama` - Good for logical reasoning

**Output Formatting:**
- ü§ñ **AI Commands** - Displayed in **cyan** 
- üìú **Game Responses** - Displayed in **yellow**
- ‚ñ∂ **Turn Headers** - Displayed in **green**
- Debug messages (with `--verbose`) - Displayed in **grey**

## Save & Resume Feature

The application automatically saves your game progress:

**Auto-Save Behavior:**
- Saves every 10 turns automatically
- Saves when you exit or quit
- Saves to `games/saves/<gamename>_autosave.qzl` by default (Quetzal format)

**Resuming from Save:**
When you restart the application, if a save file exists, you'll be prompted:
```
Found existing save file: games/saves/zork1_autosave.qzl
Resume from save? (y/n):
```

Type `y` to continue from where you left off, or `n` to start fresh.

**Custom Save File:**
```bash
# Use your own save file location (Frotz will add .qzl if needed)
python zork_ai_player.py games/zork1.z5 --save-file my_progress.qzl
```

**Disable Auto-Save:**
```bash
# Run without saving (useful for testing)
python zork_ai_player.py games/zork1.z5 --no-autosave
```

**How It Works:**
The application uses Zork's built-in SAVE and RESTORE commands. Save files are created in Quetzal format (.qzl) by Frotz and are compatible with any Z-machine interpreter (you could load them in a regular Frotz session).

## AI Learning System üß†

The AI player includes an intelligent learning system that captures knowledge across game sessions:

**What the AI Learns:**
- **Location Insights**: Details about rooms, passages, traps, and treasures
- **Item Information**: What items do, where they're found, how to use them
- **Puzzle Solutions**: Hints about locked doors, switches, and other obstacles
- **General Facts**: What works, what doesn't, and successful strategies
- **Map Data**: Location connections, navigation paths, and spatial relationships

**Learning Features:**
- **Persistent Memory**: AI remembers discoveries from previous sessions
- **Smart Context**: Only relevant knowledge is provided to keep token usage low
- **Automatic Extraction**: Learning happens automatically during gameplay
- **Efficient Storage**: Knowledge saved as lightweight JSON files
- **Map Building**: Creates a mental map of locations and connections
- **Navigation Memory**: Remembers where it can go from each location

**Learning Files:**
- `games/saves/zork1_learning.json` - Contains AI's accumulated knowledge
- Automatically saved every 10 turns and when exiting
- Loaded automatically when resuming a game

**Example Learning Data:**
```json
{
  "learned_facts": [
    "Cannot open door - It's locked",
    "Successfully took lamp with TAKE LAMP"
  ],
  "location_insights": {
    "Living Room": ["There is a lamp here", "Passage to north"]
  },
  "item_insights": {
    "lamp": "A brass lamp that provides light"
  },
  "puzzle_solutions": {
    "door_puzzle": "Need to find key"
  },
  "location_map": {
    "Living Room": ["north", "east", "west"],
    "Kitchen": ["up", "west", "east"]
  },
  "location_names": {
    "Living Room": "Living Room",
    "Kitchen": "Kitchen"
  },
  "visited_locations": ["Living Room", "Kitchen"],
  "current_location": "Kitchen"
}
```

**Benefits:**
- AI makes better decisions based on previous experience
- Avoids repeating failed strategies
- Remembers successful approaches
- Builds knowledge progressively across sessions
- Creates a mental map for better navigation
- Remembers location connections and exits

## Customization

### Using OpenAI Instead of Claude

To use OpenAI's API instead, modify the `zork_ai_player.py` to use the OpenAI SDK:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY'))

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": self.system_prompt},
        *self.conversation_history
    ]
)
command = response.choices[0].message.content
```

### Adjusting AI Behavior

Edit the `system_prompt` in `zork_ai_player.py` to change:
- Play style (aggressive vs cautious)
- Focus (exploration vs treasure hunting)
- Command complexity
- Strategy approach

## Troubleshooting

**dfrotz not found:**
```bash
# Make sure Frotz is installed
brew install frotz  # macOS
which dfrotz        # Should show path to binary
```

**API Key Error:**
```bash
# Verify your key is set
echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

**Game file not loading:**
```bash
# Check file exists and is readable
ls -la games/zork1.z5
file games/zork1.z5  # Should show "Z-machine"
```

**No game output:**
- Increase timeouts in `_read_game_output()` method
- Run with `--verbose` flag to see debug messages
- Check if `dfrotz` is working: `dfrotz games/zork1.z5`
